## 🎥 ANIMATION PHILOSOPHY

**Every motion asks: "Does this support the emotion?"**

### Timing
- Page Entry: 1200ms (slow, cinematic)
- Text Lines: 800ms each, 400ms delay between
- Scroll Reveals: 1000ms (inevitable feeling)
- Button Hovers: 600ms (responsive, not reactive)
- Page Transitions: 600ms exit + 1200ms enter

### Easing
- `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)` — Soft arrival (main animations)
- `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` — Smooth interactions (buttons)

### Feel
- Never instant (always intentional)
- Never bouncy (always controlled)
- Never harsh (always gentle)
- Like a deep breath, not excitement

> "Romance deserves beautiful code. Not because anyone will see it, but because it's built with care."

It proves that you don't need:
- ✅ Frameworks
- ✅ Libraries
- ✅ Complexity
- ✅ Buzzwords

You just need:
- ✅ Clean HTML

- ✅ Care in every detail

The result feels less like a "website" and more like a carefully designed love letter.

---

## 🎉 YOU'RE ALL SET

Everything is:
- ✅ Complete
- ✅ Production-ready
- ✅ Fully documented
- ✅ Easy to customize
- ✅ Ready to deploy
- ✅ Ready to share

All you need to do is:

1. **Experience it** — Open `index.html`
